# FT_tech_test

The Task:
Build a website that shows a list of news headlines from Financial Times. You may use our Developer APIs to achieve this.
Provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines).
Optionally, provide pagination for results, at 20 results per page. This website should be:

* Server-rendered
* Progressively enhanced
* Responsive
* Accessible

For bonus points, the site should:

* Be built using Javascript and node.js
* Be deployed on Heroku
* Not rely too heavily on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
* Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
* Be performant over 3G networks

It'd be really awesome if, on top of all that, your site:
* Uses Origami Components
* Works offline

Please submit both links to your functioning app and source repo. Make sure you bring your source code to the face to face interview.

Be careful when pushing your code publicly to a version control system like github, as other applicants may have access to your code. Entries deemed too similar will be immediately disqualified.
